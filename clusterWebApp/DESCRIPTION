Description: An interactive platform for clustering analysis and teaching based on the 'shiny' web application framework.
    Supports multiple popular clustering algorithms including k-means, hierarchical clustering,
    DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids),
    GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model), and spectral clustering. Users can upload datasets or use built-in ones,
    visualize clustering results using dimensionality reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), evaluate clustering quality via silhouette plots,
    and explore method-specific visualizations and guides. For details on implemented methods, see:
    Reynolds (2009, ISBN:9781598296975) for GMM;
    Luxburg (2007) <doi:10.1007/s11222-007-9033-z> for spectral clustering.
